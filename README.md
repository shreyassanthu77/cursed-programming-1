# First Annual Cursed Programming Event

## What is this?

Pretty simple. Submit a PR with the most terrible, horrible, atrocities you can think of committing in code. And then DO IT!

## Some Ideas

- Vulkan but single line
- Code where every line is commented
- C compiler in JS and/or PHP
- Merging FE frameworks like React, Svelte, Vue, for no good reason
- Assembly code that runs malbolge
-  an entire program in C using only gotos for jumping? No functions except main (obviously stuff like std lib function calls would have to be allowed).
- borrow checker in rust
- some kind of transpiler that outputs filenames like js.c.h.bindings.c.js
- transpile zig code to rust written in go
- use db stored functions as backend exclusively
- sql to css transpiler

## Why would you want to do this?

The primary reason? For charity. Once we have enough submissions, we will schedule a 24 hour review stream to review all the PRs in this repo. During that time, we will be donating to charity.

The chosen charity this year is: https://www.bcchf.ca/

A secondary reason is to showcase peoples skills. Believe it or not, it takes a lot to *purposefully* and *skillfully* write some cursed project in a way that:

- makes sense
- is fun to read
- elegantly highlights why this is cursed
- covers some unusual domain

Hopefully, showcasing your work and getting enough attention on the 24 hour streams will help a few of you get seen, find jobs or get some well deserved attention on your work.

If we can, we may also pick a few content streamers and set aside some "sub bombs" for their content in the near future.

## Dates

- START DATE: NOW
- END DATE: Friday, February 9th, 2024
